The **growth mindset** can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately, and I sometimes say to myself *“Self, you need to embrace the growth mindset. The growth mindset is cool.”*

## What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

## as a reminder for me to keep myself in a grouth mindset this is what i do:
1. smile 
2. be positive 
3. and meditate from time to time
