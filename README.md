on first of what you need to know is that markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

markdown is a way to style text on the web. and you can do a lot of styling with markdown such as: formatting words as bold and italic, adding images, adding links..... etc.

and of Corse you cane use markdown most places around GitHub:

Gists (Links to an external site.)
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension
the key to use markdown styling is by symbols, and it is impressive what you can do with just symbols like: (#,*/-,[],.....) and even adding images also links and sometimes both.

and for example here are a few:

1. # This is an h1 tag
2. ## This is an h2 tag
3. ###### This is an h6 tag
  
  * *This text will be italic* 
* _This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**

__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
